# kzyno ðŸŽ²

A decentralized casino built on Solana where players are the house.

## Overview

kzyno is not just another online casinoâ€”it's a paradigm shift in how gambling platforms operate. Built on the Solana blockchain, kzyno eliminates traditional intermediaries and puts the power back in the hands of the players.

- **Permissionless**: Anyone can participate without registration or KYC
